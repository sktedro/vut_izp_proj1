# IZP-testsuite

Testsuite for IZP first project
Author: kam29

There are several hundred tests run by this testsuite. Almost every combination of avaiable commands is tested.
Multiple table modification commands are NOT tested, because of multiple posible implementations.
Author of this testsuite is NOT responsible for correct results (there is a possibility of an
	error or of different interpretation of certain features) - so don't panic, if there are some failed tests

Usage:
	Move your "sheet" executable file and "testsuite.py" file into the same directory
	(alternatively you can use --executable argument to testsuite to specify your executable).
	Run by typing "python2 ./testsuite.py". For every failed test, there is detailed description in generated log file.
	For list of advance options avaiable by arguments type "python2 ./testsuite.py --help".

ENJOY
